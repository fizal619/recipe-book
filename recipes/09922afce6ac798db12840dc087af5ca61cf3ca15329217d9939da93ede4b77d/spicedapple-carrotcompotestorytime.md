<h1 class="western">Ingredients</h1>
<p>Number of servings and amount of ingredients may vary. These
amounts are based on what I find in the supermarket + the ratio I
like.</p>
<h2 class="western">Body:</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">- 1kg of apples</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">- 1/3kg carrots</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">- honey</p>
<h2 class="western">Optional additions:</h2>
<p>- figs<br/>
- pears<br/>
- nuts, e.g. pecan, walnut (bonus point
for toasting* beforehand)</p>
<h2 class="western">Spices:</h2>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0cm">- cinnamon<br/>
-
chinese 5 spice mix**<br/>
- optional (for extra zest/spicy): ginger
(fresh or dried/ground)</p>
<h1 class="western">Instructions</h1>
<p>1. Clean the carrots and dice into small pieces. Add to the pan
with a small (!) splash of water and put heat on medium-low. Put on
lid to start steaming the carrots.</p>
<p>	- The carrot won’t fall apart in the final compote so make sure
you dice them fine enough!</p>
<p>2. Meanwhile, core the apples and cut them into small chunks. Add
to the pan and stir, close the lid.<br/>
If you’re adding other
fruits, cut them up &amp; add them now.</p>
<p>	- I opt not to remove the skin of the apples. Though they won’t
fall apart completely, they add pectin (a thickening agent) to the
mix, and they’re quite nutricious. You can remove them if you’d
like, though.</p>
<p>3. Let simmer for approximately one hour, or until the apple
chunks disintegrate. Stir occasionally.</p>
<p>4. Once the consistency starts becoming mushy, take stock of how
watery the compote is. If it’s too thick to your tastes, add a
splash of water. If it’s too thin, leave the lid off from this
point on and continue to simmer on low heat to evaporate water.</p>
<p>5. Add &amp; stir in honey and spices to taste. If you’re adding
nuts, dice/crush them and add them now.</p>
<p>6. Put the lid on and let sit for another hour to soak in flavour
as it cools down. Then distribute amongst containers, and keep in the
fridge for ~a week or freeze.</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p>* Can be done in an oven or a pan, I prefer the latter: add to a
pan over medium heat with no oil, and stir vigorously and
continuously until golden/brown and fragrant. Remove from pan when
done, or they’ll burn!</p>

<p>Ah, the <b>massive</b> wall of text meant to increase the number
of ads you have to scroll past to make it to the recipe! No, not
really – but this particular recipe, simple as it is, is a bit dear
to my heart, so I thought I’d share with you the story of how it
came to be.</p>
<p>  Originally, I started making a simple apple compote during my
studies in Wageningen (to do <i>something</i><span style="font-style: normal">
with the seasonal cheap 1kg bags of apples in the supermarket). I’d
seen my parents make such compotes from their garden’s apples since
I was young, so I knew how easy and tasty of a preservative method
this is – and how well it pairs with cinnamon! Naturally, I started
experimenting – adding figs, pears, cinnamon, other warm spices I’d
seen my housemates use in their dishes (hence the 5 spice mix) –
and inevitably I tried to add the other massively downpriced seasonal
produce available: carrots. I quickly discovered this was not only
quite tasty, but quite a fibre-bomb as well (suffice it to say, some
level of caution is advised if you don’t eat </span><span style="font-style: normal">that
</span><span style="font-style: normal">many carrots often…!)</span></p>
<p style="font-style: normal">  Fast-forward some time to my
half-year stay in Ballerup, Denmark, where I was doing an internship
at Copenhagen’s technical university. Although I am grateful for my
time there, to say it was quite hard is accurate. Since I didn’t
speak the language, found myself living far out from Copenhagen’s
thriving, diverse center, and wasn’t an enrolled student at the
university, I had no easy ways of socialising with the little time
and energy I’d have left after work. I barely had time or energy
for hobbies. The Danish autumnal weather was cold and rainy – and
the latitude meant it soon started getting dark at 3 in the
afternoon, meaning I’d barely see the sun during weekdays. Because
of the massive price hike in utility costs at the time and the
general higher cost of living in the north, I didn’t use my
studio’s heating for the first 3 months of living there (I changed
my mind when I caught covid…). Everyday, I’d cycle 26km through
this cold, work 8 hours, do groceries, do chores and cook to power me
through everything. 
</p>
<p>  <span style="font-style: normal">And it was cooking that was the
highlight of my day. I realised before I even went over that my time
there would be hard, so I laid out a framework of self-care: a strict
routine that involved me cooking good, tasty, nutricious dinners &amp;
</span><span style="font-style: normal">prep </span><span style="font-style: normal">lunches
every day. As long as I could set aside everything else and spend
time organising and cleaning my kitchen and making good food for
myself, I was taking care of my wellbeing. And that, I did; I cooked
every single day of my stay there, and had a great time bonding with
my coworkers over our love of good food.</span></p>
<p>  <span style="font-style: normal">Whenever I visit a new country,
one of the first things I do is explore the food culture –
including what is available in the supermarkets. It gives some idea
of how local people eat, and what they prioritise.* Compared to Dutch
ones, Danish supermarkets offer less variety in vegetables; and there
is a larger difference in both price and quality between locally
produced, seasonal food, and imported and/or greenhouse-grown food
(likely due to the Netherlands’ insane greenhouse industry).
Additionally, Danish food is more expensive in general. So, since it
was autumn, there were two types of produce coming in from the </span><span style="font-style: normal">hardy
</span><span style="font-style: normal">Danish farmland that were
cheap </span><i>en masse:</i><span style="font-style: normal"> you
guessed it, apples and carrots.</span></p>
<p>  <span style="font-style: normal">And so it was I spen</span><span style="font-style: normal">t
</span><span style="font-style: normal">many an evening making
multiple batches of this compote in my too-little pan on the equally
too-little induction stove – an almost meditative procedure as I
washed, cut and cooked 2 kilograms of apples and carrots at a time.
I’d spice it to hell and back to keep me warm, freeze it into
portions in any container I could get my hands on (mostly a lot of
washed and re-used jars) and </span><span style="font-style: normal">eat</span><span style="font-style: normal">
it with everything: on toast, in my yoghurt, purely as dessert or
snack. </span>
</p>
<p>  <span style="font-style: normal">Consequently, to this day, I
</span><span style="font-style: normal">think of</span><span style="font-style: normal">
making this compote as a slow-down; a quiet moment of </span><i>mise-en-place;
</i><span style="font-style: normal">the process of cutting apples a
meditation to a hectic mind, </span><span style="font-style: normal">and</span><span style="font-style: normal">
</span><span style="font-style: normal">my shitty little kitchen</span><i>
</i><span style="font-style: normal">a</span><span style="font-style: normal">n</span><span style="font-style: normal">
oasis in a hectic world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">I’m not kidding about the
fibre, though.</span></p>
<p><br/>
<br/>

<p><span style="font-style: normal">* The supermarket I frequented
had an </span><i>aisle</i><span style="font-style: normal"> of fruit
jams, but only two types of peanut butter available. Candy was
massively expensive due to sugar taxes, and thus came in little
portions. Nuts varied greatly in price because they were all taxed
separately (maybe this explains the peanut butter?). Beer was kept in
a different aisle (usually next to the store entrance, lol) from the
rest of the alcohol (most of which supermarkets aren’t allowed to
sell in the Netherlands). Supermarket bread was poor quality, but
pastries were great. They had also dedicated a non-insigificant part
of the store to both frozen &amp; fresh meats, but had only three
vegetarian meat replacers in a hard-to-find corner – next to the
deepfried meat snacks! To say this was a culture shock coming from
Wageningen – the Netherlands’ most #sustainable tree-hugging city
– isn’t an understatement!</span></p>
