<p style="text-align:center">Easy, cheap and quick veggie-rich soup</p>


Prep time:  ~10 min (during cooking)
Cooking time: ~20 min

Dietary notes:
    - Contains dairy
    - Contains lactose
    - Swap the crème fraiche/cream for a vegan equivalent to make vegan and lactose-free; or leave it out all together to make a non-creamy (&vegan) version

Additional notes:
    - Keeps well in the freezer. Tip: if zucchinis are on sale, buy a bunch, make a panfull of soup, and freeze in portions :)

<b>Ingredients</b>
Makes for 2 hungry or 3 ordinary servings. Easily scaleable provided your pan is big enough.

<b>Body:</b>
    - 2 zucchinis
    - veggie broth
    - half a big or 1 small (yellow) onion
    - 2 (or more) cloves of garlic
    - olive oil (pref cold pressed/vierge)
    - lemon juice (pref freshly squeezed)
    - crème fraiche/heavy cream

<b>Spices/herbs</b>:
    - salt & pepper
    - pref fresh (dry also works) herbs: thyme & rosemary
    - optional herbs: sage, bay leaf

<b>Serve with:</b>
    - bread, for carbs and to soak in soup
    - cheese, for fat&protein and pairs nicely with the bread
    - if vegan, olive oil dip* to dip bread into. Delicious and provides fats

<b>Instructions</b>
1. Heat up olive oil in a (large) pan. Don’t be afraid to use quite a bit of oil, this is tasty in the soup later.
2. Dice the onion and add when the oil is hot. Toss to coat. Set heat to medium-low.
3. Dice (or squeeze) and add garlic
4. Chop up the zucchini as small as you can manage. When the onion is looking glassy/a little brownish and you can start to smell it, add the zucchini and set heat to medium.
5. Add salt (to draw out moisture) to the pan and mix.
6. Fry for about 5-10 minutes. Cut 1/3 of a lemon & prep your broth if it comes in powder form (dissolve in ~1L of boiling water) in the meantime.
7. Add broth & lemon juice to the pan and stir. Keep heat to just-boiling/simmering.
	- If you’re adding a bay leaf, do it now.
8. Whilst the soup is simmering, clean&chop your herbs.
9. The soup is getting ready once the zucchini starts falling apart a little. Add this point, mix in a tablespoon of crème fraiche/heavy cream and add the herbs. Turn off the heat, add lid and let sit for another 5 min or so.

* Olive oil dip recipe:
 	- Vierge olive oil. The more green&aromatic, the better
	- Lemon or lime juice (I prefer lemon & freshly squeezed)
	- Salt & pepper
	- optional: garlic
