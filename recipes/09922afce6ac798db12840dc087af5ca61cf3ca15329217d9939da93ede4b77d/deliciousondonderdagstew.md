Cooking time: 30min to 2h (see step

Dietary notes:<br/>
- contains meat<br/>
- optionally
contains dairy, but may be lactose-free<br/>
- mixes meat (beef) &amp;
dairy (butter, opt. milk)<br/>
- contains wine, but the alcohol will
evaporate over the course of preparation<br/>
- contains a fuckton of
antioxidants, we love <i>Allium</i> &amp; the mediterranean diet in
this house!!!</p>

<h2 class="western">Serve with:</h2>

The same wine you cooked with lol</p>
<h1 class="western">Instructions</h1>
<p>1. Heat a 1:1 mix of olive oil and butter in a big pan; this will
fry your ingredients &amp; cook your soup, so it needs to be big, and
pref. good at distributing heat; a big flat-bottom cast iron pan
would be ideal.</p>
<p>1.5 Put on some music &amp; pour yourself some wine.</p>
<p>2. Chop up your onions and toss them in. Set heat to low, stir to
coat in oil &amp; put on lid to caramelise (when in doubt err on the
side of (s)lower). Stir every once in a while.</p>
<p>3. In the meantime, add your beef to a bowl, rub in some
salt&amp;pepper, and add in a splash of red wine. Set aside to
marinate* a bit.</p>
<p>4. In a separate pan/container, add 500mL of boiling water, and
mix in an appropriate (check packaging) amount of veggie stock
(crumble), a can of concentrated tomato paste, 2 bay leaves, a big
splash of red wine**, and optionally a sprinkle of MSG.</p>
<p>5. Clean and dice your carrots, and toss them in too. Give it a
stir and cook on low heat w/ the lid on for another 5 min (main aim
here is to cook through w/ the steam from the onions)</p>
<p>6. Sprinkle some salt&amp; pepper over your sliced mushrooms.</p>
<p>7. Toss in the beef (+remaining wine) and mushrooms. Turn the heat
up to high to heat the mixture whilst stirring continuously, once
it’s heated up (you hear frying), turn down to medium-high, and
continue to stir. Main aim here is to grill/sear the meat and fry
most moisture out of the mushrooms (this is why we added salt, it
helps draw out moisture)</p>
<p>8. Once the beef starts to look white-brownish on all sides and
the mushrooms are losing volume, set heat to medium. If you don’t
see a layer of oil/moisture at the bottom whilst stirring, add a
splash of olive oil &amp; a splash of red wine and heat it up.
Sieve*** over a few tablespoons of flour one spoon at a time and mix
into the mixture. This way, you shouldn’t see clumps.</p>
<p>9. Add ~1 tsp of thyme and ~1 tsp of parsley. Cook for another 2-3
minutes to bring out the herbs’ aroma and cook the flour. You
should see the whole mixture thicken somewhat (if not, add another ts
of flour &amp; wait a bit longer whilst stirring occasionally).</p>
<p>10. Add in the soup-y mix from step 4 (and optionally, a splash of
milk). Heat up to just-about-boiling whilst stirring continuously.</p>
<p>11. Sprinkle&amp;mix in jerk seasoning to taste (~3tsp we ain’t
cowards here).</p>
<p>12. Taste &amp; season to preference. ‘Idk it’s just kinda
flat/boring’: add salt. ‘It’s missing something but idk what’:
add an acid (lemon juice, vinegar, MORE RED WINE). ‘It’s <i>still</i><span style="font-style: normal">
missing something’ add black pepper or chili pepper. ‘</span><span style="font-style: normal">It’s
dry/tart from the red wine and/or </span><span style="font-style: normal">too
</span><span style="font-style: normal">acidic’: add a bit of
sugar.  </span><span style="font-style: normal">‘It’s </span><i>still
still</i><span style="font-style: normal"> missing something’ do a
COVID test.</span></p>
<p>12. If you are real hungry, turn off the heat and serve
immediately. If you want to make Senshi proud, put the heat on low,
put on the lid, and cook for another 1,5h or until the meat is tender
whilst stirring occasionally.****</p>

<br/>

</p>
<p>* Lazy man’s marinade. Obv if you want to do this well, do it
hours beforehand and keep in the fridge until you start cooking.</p>
<p>** Adding wine to tomato (paste) will have the alcohol dissolve
alcohol-soluble (but non-water-soluble) flavour molecules, enhancing
the taste of the tomatoes in the sauce</p>
<p>*** Or loosely shake from the packaging so it remains powdered, do
I sound like I own a sieve?</p>
<p>**** Continuing with cooking after step 11 will have the meat
initially toughen, making it big thumbs down emoji – cooking it for
another ~1,5h will break down the collagen, causing it to tenderise.
Meanwhile, fats&amp;flavours from the meat and herbs will enhance the
sauce. This is scientifically referred to as ‘big yummy’ - trust
me, I have a degree in food technology.</p>
