# The Aubergine-Feta Mush Classic

An old favourite among the crusty hallways of 311E.
*Ingredients to feed 4 medium-to-very hungry students*
- 2 pides or ~10-12 pitas
- 4 or 5 aubergines 
- 2 or 3 bell peppers
- 2 onions
- at least half a head of garlic (please!)
- At least a teaspoon of cumin seeds
- At least half a teaspoon of smoked paprika (piment√≥n)
- Some salt
- 1 or 2 blocks of feta (so 200-400 g)
- At least a teaspoon of sambal oelek (Alternatively, chop up a spicy chilli with some oil and vinegar, or a hot sauce of your choice. I'd advice against sweet ones.)
- Lotsa olive oil
- Optional: Garlic sauce (garnish), lettuce or cherry tomatoes (pretend this is healthy)

*Steps*
Here's what you do. You chop the onion into bits. You can do half-rings if you're feeling adventurous - I actually prefer that - but chopped fine works too. If you do half rings, make the rings nice and thin. If you don't have garlic press, chop up the garlic nice and fine too.

Chop up the aubergines in cubes roughly 2 cm across. Also chop up the peppers in bits that make you happy - I prefer them a bit on the finer side, but we all have days when chonky is better, right? You have taste, because you're on this awesome site - eyeball what you prefer :3

Before you start cooking stuff, think ahead: How do you want to prep your bread? With a toaster, or in the oven? If it's the oven, make sure to pre-heat it to a temperature appropriate for the bread.

Heat up a nice saucepan and add some healthy glugs of olive oil. Be generous! You want the aubergine to slorp that up later, because it brings all involved happiness. Once the oil is a bit warm (it's olive oil, don't overdo it), add the onion and the garlic (press the garlic if you didn't chop it). Stir that up, make it fry. While it's still frying, add at least a teaspoon of cumin seeds and sambal oelek to taste. I use 1 teaspoon (or a little less) if it's for friends who prefer the milder side, but I'll admit - 2 steaspoons is where the nice tasty comes in.

Let that all fry for a ltitle bit until the onions are a little bit done. Don't be afraid to give it some time. Onions are allowed to caramelize, but they don't have to. Once you're happy with the state of the onions, add the aubergine to the pan. If you were skimpy with the olive oil before, don't be afraid to live a little and add some more! This dish can (and should) be a bit fatty and oily. Remember, you're feeding the spirit of hungry students. Also add a bit of salt at this stage, to taste. Keep in mind that the feta is salty too, and will be added later! Let that fry for a bit on medium heat, stirring every now and then. While the aubergine is cooking, you can chop up the bell peppers in between stirs.

You'll know when the aubergine is getting somewhere if it's becoming a bit floppy, really saturated by the olive oil, most of the water evaporated. I personally don't mind if it's a bit mushy, even. Once that's the case (or when it's approaching that state) you can add the bell pepper. If you're in a rush, you could also add the bell pepper after 1 or 2 minutes (basically when the pan is back to heat after adding the aubergine), but then it'll fry a little less and have bit more of a 'cooked' vibe. 

While the bell pepper is cooking, chop up the feta into cubes (1 or 2 cm across; it'll mush up a bit anyway). After about 10 minutes of cooking the bellpepper (or less, if you like the crunch; don't be afraid to taste it!), turn down the heat to a bare minimum and add the feta on top. Meanwhile, make sure your bread is in the oven - you're only a few minutes away from being ready! Keep stirring while the feta melts.

Once the feta is a bit melted (there can still be some clumps!) you're done. Take it off the heat while you wait for your bread to finish (I always start the bread too late). Put the wonderful mush you've created into either the pita's or into halved (or quarted) pides. If you go for the pide approach, I recommend cutting it open into 'pockets', but hey, go crazy with it.

If you opted for the healty optionals, you can shove them in there along with the rest of the mixture. Don't forget some garlic sauce for garnish, it's delicious. Also, don't be afraid to put some more sambal oelek up in that bad girl if you are cooking for people who don't like spice; the sour vibe of it adds a lot.
